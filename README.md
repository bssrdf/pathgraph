# Path Graph
Pretty visualizations for ray tracing algorithms

Hosted at [darioseyb.com](https://darioseyb.com/pathgraph)

This project was born out of my frustation with making figures that illustrate processes in ray/path tracing algorithm. Particularly in the context of my seminar report about ["Gradient Domain Path Tracing"](https://darioseyb.com/report/gdpt.html) creating figures by hand was not feasible.

Path Graph gives you a flexible framework to visualize all kinds of situations. It provides varioues visualization modes and SVG export functionality. This way you can put final touches on your figures in your favourite vector graphics editing tool.
